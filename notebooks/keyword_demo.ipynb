# Keyword Extraction Demo
This notebook demonstrates extracting overlapping keywords between Resume and Job Description.
resume = open("../data/sample_resume.txt").read()
jd = open("../data/sample_jd.txt").read()
resume_words = set(resume.lower().split())
jd_words = set(jd.lower().split())

overlaps = resume_words.intersection(jd_words)

# Similarity Score Demo

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
emb1 = model.encode([resume])[0]
emb2 = model.encode([jd])[0]
cosine_similarity([emb1], [emb2])
